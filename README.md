# wine-quality-prediction---deployment
Here, I using the wine dataset to predict the quality of wine. 

- The model is built using Random Forest Classifier.

- If the predicted wine quality is greater than 7, it is good quality. If the predicted wine quality is less tha 7, it is bad quality wine.

## About the DataSet:

- Size of the DataSet : 1599 records * 12 features

- The datasets consist of several features include:

- volatile acidity : Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.

- fixed acidity : Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic.

- residual sugar : Amount of sugar left after fermentation.

- citric acid : It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.

- chlorides : Amount of salt present in wine.

- free sulfur dioxide : So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.

- total sulfur dioxide : is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2.

- pH : In wine pH is used for checking acidity.

- density : sweeter wines have a higher density.

- sulphates : Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.

- alcohol : Percent of alcohol present in wine.

- quality : Quality of the wine
